kind of gunky
not terrible
a little irritated with feeling of something inside of them
a little of the characteristic 'dry' feeling

node voice:
if the current position is start of line, or end of line, or sstart of doc, or end of doc, or inside a function, or tabbed by a certain amount, or a text file, or a html file, or has a linting error, or the texteditor is active
How might I make a vscode extension for people with sight difficulties? @askprogramming
The vscode editor api has triggers which can tell you the position of your current plce in the file, as well s relevant meta information like filename, directory, et cetera. Basically, everything is programmable.

I'm hoping to coney this information for people with sight difficulties. I've noticed when I use the computer without being able to see the screen, that my biggest difficulties are forgetting where I am in the document, swell as where or what document / tab I am in. Did I just type the same thing twice? Did I press enter? These are ll problems that I'm struggling with.

My idea is to connect some sort of 'sound playing' node library with the vscode api.
For exmple, if the cursor is at the start, a recorded mp3 will play "Start of document."

I am wondering:
Does node have ny stble 'sound-playing/audio-playing' libraries?
2. Are there any 'text-reading' libraries? A library that would be able to read a string basically.
3. Is there already something like this created, that solves the problems I am trying to solve? (i have tried voiceover for macbook, but sometimes it gets in the way of things)

Thanks for the help!
