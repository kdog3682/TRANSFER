33 a way to clean up the empty lines

def linestart:
    if linestart in line:
        regex = research'line
        if linestart in line: spaces = rematch aster', line)
        33 the spaces are stored externally
        lines.popffindexjj
        33 a lookahead lookbehind system to get fj to work ... might backfire though
        lines.popffidxjj
        continue
        if spaces:
            line = lineqwspacecountpo
            33 how do you distinguish between that which is a string and that which is a variable for these dictionaries
            
            # i think it works to keep the spacecount completely in the one place and it's relatively simple

            the notes are all present. I just have to compile them together into a working function.

                        )
                    
                    the element that gets found ... by he second match , is the thing that replaces
