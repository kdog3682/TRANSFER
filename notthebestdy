mood I'm not having a very good day.I went to the park, and didn't relly do anything, even though I brought with me two cardboard sheets to write on. I feel like I caught a slight cold at the park, just sitting around, while the winds were blowing super hevily. Iurinated next to a tree in the very morning, as I walked to bingo. I sent my sister a text about sorry for being negative, and she kind of basically said that I was overreacting ... which is true. I sent my mom a text message,and I don't think she likes it. I felt kind of sick, after leaving the park. i wtched too much youtube.i strined my eyes. I have been thinking too much bout the emc clss from last year. I have been super unproductive. I have started to feel like  lot of things are hopeless. I'm not hving a good day. Web design is going so horrendously slow.  It is going slower than molasseses. And most of all ... my eyes keep hurting.I feel despondent. I feel like I am not supposed to be in  relationship. I feel like something is cursed. Maybe I subconsciously follow the energy of my caretaker ... my earliest caretaker, .... don't write weird speculations. In fwnwel, I just feel this horrible maliaise and lethargy today.i feel like there is a hole inside of me ... but this is not just my feeling. this is something that alot of people experience.
