What causes dry mouth in the morning? @nsq

Despite drinking lots of water in the previous evening, lately I have been waking up with a sensation of immense dryness in my mouth. It's the kind of feeling that kind of extends into the back of your throat, like a raspiness. This will prompt me to drink like 3 to 4 glassses of water, which will make it feel slightly better, but there will still be a lingering feeling of 'dryness.'

Might anyone have an idea aso to why something like this occurs?

Thanks!

What is a technique that you commonly use / enjoy using, when you write javascript? @ljs

I guess this question shouldn't be restricted to just javascript, but rather coding in general. For me, I do a lot of organizing / partitioning, and something thata I find myself always writing, is the following pattern:

    
asd let store = {} asd for let line of lines asd if line in store: store[line] = [] asd store[line].pushfflinejj

I hve used this pattern so many times, that it has become kind of a favorite of mine. I'm wondering what you dn
