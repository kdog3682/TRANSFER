What would be a way to solve these 2 split problems? @lp
The first problem isto split at the first encountered space, and only limit it to 2 items. So for example, 'I like dogs' should be split into 'I' and 'like dogs'.

The second split question is to do the same as the first, except split at the last space. "Fish and chips" would become "fish and" , and "chips". "hello   goodbye" would become 'hello'  ", and "'goodbye'.
